This is the project for the Network Programming course (A.Y. 24-25)

## Implementation of a Minimal Web Server in Python and Deployment of a Static Website
The goal of the project is to implement a web server in Python that responds to HTTP requests on port 8080. The server must be able to:
- Handle HTTP requests.
- Respond with 200 OK for valid requests (4 static HTML pages) and 404 for invalid ones.
- Manage the MIME type for different types of files to be returned (text/html, style/css, image/img, application/pdf).
- Log incoming requests.
